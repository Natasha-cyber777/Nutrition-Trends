Firebase Configuration (Environment Variables):
This project connects to Firebase. To ensure your sensitive API keys are not exposed, you must use environment variables.

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.

Add your Firebase project's configuration details. You can find these in your Firebase project console (Project overview -> Project settings -> General -> Your apps -> Web app section). Remember to prefix variables with REACT_APP_ for Create React App projects:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

Crucially, ensure .env is listed in your .gitignore file.

This command will launch the development server, and the Nutrition Trends app should open in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
